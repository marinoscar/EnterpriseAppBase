// =============================================================================
// EmailNotificationChannel (issue #125, epic #109)
// =============================================================================
//
// The one implemented channel. It joins the three halves #121–#123 built and
// left unconnected: an event key from the registry, a template from
// `../../email/templates`, and a transport from `../../email/providers`.
//
// IT IS A CHANNEL, NOT "THE" CHANNEL. `NotificationsService` reaches it only
// through `NotificationChannelSender`, so #127's browser channel is a sibling
// class and a line in the module factory rather than a branch anywhere in the
// dispatcher.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS DUPLICATES SOME OF `EmailTestSendService`'s GATING
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Both check `enabled`, `provider` and `fromAddress` before sending. That is
// deliberate rather than an extraction waiting to happen, because the two want
// OPPOSITE things from a failure. #124's test send is a DIAGNOSTIC: its whole
// output is a sentence for an admin staring at the settings form, it writes an
// `email_settings:test` audit row, and it returns a `TestEmailResult`. This is
// a DELIVERY path: its output is a `notification_deliveries` row, it has no
// admin looking at it, and it must never write an audit event for a message
// nobody asked to send.
//
// What IS shared is the part where duplication would be a bug rather than
// noise: `formatFromHeader` — header escaping, where a second implementation
// means either mail from nobody or an injected header. #124 exported it for
// exactly this call site.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// NEVER THROWS — AND YET A THROTTLE CAN STILL PAUSE A BROADCAST (issue #456)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// This channel's failures cannot fail the caller: every refusal becomes a
// `{ success: false }` result and a `failed` delivery row. Until #456 that
// also meant a PROVIDER THROTTLE could not slow anything down — the
// broadcast fan-out kept dispatching into a provider that was refusing it,
// and the rest of the audience was written off one failed row at a time.
//
// The fix keeps the contract and adds a fact to the result: when the
// transport classifies its error as a throttle (`BaseEmailProvider` →
// `classifyEmailRateLimit`), this channel returns `rateLimited: true` (and
// the provider's `retryAfterMs`). `NotificationsService.notifyNow` — and only
// `notifyNow`, the awaited path — aggregates that into its result, and
// `BroadcastChunkHandler` turns it into a `RateLimitError`, which is the
// queue's own backpressure mechanism. The throw happens in the one place that
// is ALLOWED to throw (a job handler), about the one thing the queue already
// knows how to handle (a deferral), and nowhere else.
// =============================================================================

// `EVENT_EMAIL_TEMPLATES` (a frozen snapshot of the binding registry) is gone from the
// package since #738: taken at package load, before the app's manifest ran,
// it would be empty. The channel reads the registry live; the reference app
// keeps the snapshot in `apps/api/src/platform/notifications/index.ts`.

   * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * WHY THIS CATCHES, WHEN `renderEmailTemplate` DOCUMENTS THAT IT DOES NOT
   * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   *
   * #123's rule — templates are pure, total, synchronous, so wrapping a render
   * only hides a genuine bug — holds at a call site where the payload's TYPE
   * is known, which is where `renderEmailTemplate` is meant to be used and
   * where a mismatch is a compile error.
   *
   * This call site is the one place in the system where it is not. `notify`
   * takes `data: unknown` on purpose, so the payload's shape is checked by
   * nothing, and a template reading `data.actor.email` on a caller's typo
   * throws a `TypeError` at runtime. Letting that propagate would violate the
   * containment rule the whole issue is built on — a bad payload for a welcome
   * email would take down the login that triggered it.
   *
   * So it is caught, and it is recorded as a FAILED delivery with the thrown
   * message. The bug is not hidden; it is written down, in the table an
   * operator queries for exactly this, instead of being converted into a 500
   * for an unrelated user action.
   *
   * `findEmailTemplate` (not `renderEmailTemplate`) because the name is not
   * statically known here — it came out of a runtime map keyed by event.
