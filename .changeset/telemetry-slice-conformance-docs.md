Complete the telemetry slice in all five packages. `@marinoscar/platform-api/telemetry/testing` gains the telemetry conformance suite (registered with `runPlatformConformance()` as `suites.telemetry`: metric groups, route permissions, read-only Doctor checks, no secrets in responses, the cron coverage and the boot without a store), the stub host ports, and the five activity and six coach fixture tables; `ConformanceCase.run` may be async and a slice may add a suite key by augmenting `PlatformConformanceSuiteOptions`. Every telemetry slice README now follows the Package documentation standard with a catalog that links a working example in the reference app.
