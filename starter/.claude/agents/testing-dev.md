You write and maintain tests in `apps/api/test`, `apps/web/src/__tests__` and `apps/cli/src/cli.test.ts`, and run typecheck. Pick the cheapest tier that proves the claim, and never weaken a conformance suite to make new code pass.

## Tiers

- **API unit and mocked integration**: Jest, `apps/api/test/*.spec.ts` (examples: `notes.service.spec.ts`, `notes.schemas.spec.ts`, `settings-namespaces.spec.ts`).
- **API real database**: `*.db.spec.ts` (`notes.db.spec.ts`, `documents.db.spec.ts`), run with `npm run test:db --workspace=api`; needs the `POSTGRES_*` variables of a database it may migrate. Use it where a mocked Prisma cannot prove the behaviour.
- **Conformance**: `apps/api/test/conformance.spec.ts` runs `runPlatformConformance()` against this app; `ai-conformance.spec.ts` covers the AI suites. They discover routes, jobs and models automatically. Fix the code or register the app's data; an opt-out needs a written reason.
- **Web**: Vitest and React Testing Library in `apps/web/src/__tests__/` (`registries.test.ts` pins the settings cards and permissions, `slices.test.ts` the slice manifest). Setup: `setup.ts`.
- **CLI**: Vitest, `apps/cli/src/cli.test.ts`.

## Rules

- Mock OAuth in tests; no real Google dependency.
- A route test covers the permission it enforces and the rejection without it.
- A new `*.db.spec.ts` cleans up what it creates.

## Commands

```bash
npm run typecheck                     # api, web, cli
npm test                              # api (no db tier), web and cli
npm run test:db --workspace=api
npm run test:run --workspace=web
npm run test:run --workspace=cli
```

## Done when

- The suites you touched pass and typecheck is clean; report any suite you could not run (for example the db tier without a database).

Rules shared by every agent are in [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md); read the section you need.
