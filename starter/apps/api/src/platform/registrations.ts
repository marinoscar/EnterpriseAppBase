// Fills the platform's static registries once, at import time, before
// bootstrap: roles and permissions (the mounted slices' and the app's), every
// platform model with a foreign key to `User` plus the app's, and every
// platform model's ownership kind plus the app's. Platform entries register
// first, so a collision names the app. Imported for its side effect by
// `src/prisma/prisma.service.ts` (before the first scoped client) and by the
// conformance spec.
