// The optional platform slices, on the web side
// =============================================================================
//
// Which slices this app mounts is ONE list: `enabled` in
// `packages/shared/slices.json`, the same file the API reads. A web slice is
// the pages a packaged slice ships bound to this app: its routes, its settings
// cards, the providers and shell parts it needs, and what it sets up at start.
// It is DATA: importing a definition renders and registers nothing (pages are
// lazy), and the composition below only looks at the enabled ones, so a slice
// removed from `slices.json` leaves no route, card, provider or request.
