// =============================================================================
// BrowserNotificationChannel (issue #127, epic #109)
// =============================================================================
//
// The second `NotificationChannelSender`, and the one #125 deliberately
// refused to stub. It does two things, IN THIS ORDER, and the order is the
// design:
//
//   1. WRITE a `notifications` row — the durable, per-user inbox.
//   2. PUBLISH to whatever streams that user currently has open.
//
// Step 1 is the delivery. Step 2 is liveness. If step 2 reaches nobody —
// because no tab is open, because the tab is connected to a different replica,
// because the network dropped a second ago — the notification has still been
// delivered and the bell will show it. Reversing the order, or treating a
// zero-subscriber publish as a failure, would make the browser channel report
// failed deliveries for the ordinary case of a user who is not currently
// looking at the app.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THE ROW IS THE PRODUCT AND THE OS TOAST IS NOT
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Nothing in this file raises a native `Notification`. It cannot: the Web API
// lives in the page, and whether it fires depends on a permission this server
// has no visibility into and no way to influence. The web half of #127 may
// turn a streamed event into a toast if permission happens to be `granted`,
// and does nothing if it is not.
//
// That is exactly why the row exists. Browser notification permission is
// denied often and, once denied, effectively permanently — the app cannot
// re-prompt. A channel whose only artefact was an OS toast would silently be a
// no-op for those accounts, including for `security.role_changed`, which is
// `mandatory: true` precisely so a privilege change is never silent. The
// server's obligation ends at a durable row the user can find; the toast is a
// decoration on top of it.
// =============================================================================

   * preferences page (#126), reviewed as product copy, and answer "what is this
   * and why did I get it?" — generically, but truthfully.

   * line and a bell that shows NOTHING for an event the registry says the user
   * should be told about — including `security.role_changed`, which is
   * `mandatory: true` exactly so it can never be silent. Generic wins.
   *
   * It is NOT silent about it: the fallback logs a `warn` naming the event, so
   * "#128 forgot a template" is visible in the same place an operator already
   * looks, rather than hiding behind plausible-looking output.
