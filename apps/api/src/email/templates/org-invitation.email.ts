// =============================================================================
// "Invitation to an organization" template — `org.invitation` (#726, PP-6.7)
// =============================================================================
//
// Modelled on `allowlist-invitation.email.ts`, and written for the same
// reader: somebody who may have NO account yet. An organization administrator
// (or, for an organization's first administrator, a deployment operator)
// invited this address; the invitation is claimed when the person signs in
// with it, and the account is created then if it does not exist.
//
// What differs from the allowlist invitation is the ORGANIZATION. A
// multi-organization deployment hosts several customers on one sign-in page,
// so the message names the organization and the role the person will hold in
// it, or "you are invited" would not say to what.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT RENDERED:
//   - the invite's `notes`: an administrator's private annotation, exactly as
//     with the allowlist entry's notes. The payload does not carry them;
//   - any token: the invitation is claimed by signing in with the invited
//     address, so there is no secret to put in a link (and nothing to log).
// =============================================================================
